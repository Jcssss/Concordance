# Concordance
Four iterations of a concordance program that searches a given text for all occurences of a set of words. After finding each occurence, the program outputs the given words and their immediate contexts in an alphabetically sorted and formatted list.

## About
This program was written for my class: SENG 265 - Software Development Methods. The program was written in 4 iteratons with each iteration requiring different features and functionality. 
 - Iteration 1 was written in C and required searching the text for the given words and then outputtng the words and their respective contexts in an alphabetical list.
 - Iteration 2 was written in Python and added to the requirements of Iteration 1 by requring that the output was formatted such that the searched words were centered and fully capitalized.
 - Iteration 3 was written in C with the same functonal requirements as Iteration 2. However, Iteration 3 also required the use of memory allocation.
 - Iteration 4 was written in Python and added to the requirements of Iteration 3 by requiring the use of regex, classes, and the ability to read input as both a text file and text input
